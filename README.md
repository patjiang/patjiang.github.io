## Graph Theory and Deep Learning Enthusiast
Hello, Welcome to my page! I probably won't update this website often but It's a good slice into what I do on the day-to-day. Although my major is in CS/Math, I also have a keen interest in protein folding and protein dynamics; particularly, the concept of high-dimensional graph representations of proteins. I have a good deal of experience working with and reading about different neural network architectures, and I will give a graphic below:

The % describes how I feel my general level of experience with each, as well as my knowledge thereof. All of my experience deploying the models have been in python, largely through google colab, but with some work on the ASU Supercomputer as well. More specifically, much of my previous work has focused on CNN's and VAE's for image generation and vector space generation, and the work on GNN's, Transformers, and PINN's relates to my work with De Novo Peptide design.

## Previous Positions
- ASU iGEM Team Leader
- Research Assistant/Software Developer @ BioProteanLab

## Current Position
- Research Assistant/Machine Learning Engineer @Singharoy Lab in Biodesign Institute

## What's in my Repository?
- Alot of old projects, some are for school, almost all of them have no README (smh). I will probably go back and work through it though.
- Mostly, my crown jewel is OpenBind, a fully end-to-end generative deep learning workflow for the development of therapeutics. Although there aren't any experimentally validated results (TBD!), I am still trying to make the code as useable and easy to understand as possible.
